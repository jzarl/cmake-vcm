CMake Version compatibility matrix
==================================

For details on the version compatibility matrix, look here:
 -> http://www.cmake.org/Wiki/CMake_Version_Compatibility_Matrix

The wiki page is created from this repository, because it's easier to maintain that way...


Basic workflow (for the interested):
------------------------------------

1) Get doctxt:

# tools/get_doctxt.sh $OLDVERSION
# tools/get_doctxt.sh $NEWVERSION

2) Create diff:

# tools/cmake_create_diff.sh

3) Do the boring work:

Look into diffs/from_cmake-$OLDVERSION.txt_to_cmake-$NEWVERSION.txt.diff and edit files
in the directory split_page/ accordingly.
